In this project, I analyzed a bike sales dataset using Excel, focusing on data cleaning, preparation, and visualization. The objective was to uncover key sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product performance to support business decision-making.
The analysis examined factors such as revenue across product categories, revenue distribution by age group, and yearly sales trends. Insights from the data helped identify the best-selling products and the most profitable markets.

The final interactive dashboard includes:

- Revenue per Country – Highlights regional profitability.
- Revenue per Product Category – Identifies the most profitable product lines.
- Revenue per Year – Tracks sales performance over time.
- Revenue by Age Bracket – Analyzes customer purchasing behavior by age group.
- Best-Selling Product – Showcases the top-performing products.

These insights enable businesses to optimize inventory management, refine marketing strategies, and enhance overall sales performance.
